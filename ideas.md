**Phase 2: Core Operations & Manipulations**
    *   Implement functions and methods to create, manipulate, and modify instances of the blueprints defined in Phase 1.
    *   Examples:
        *   Matrix operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, transpose, determinant, inverse.
        *   Set operations: union, intersection, difference, subset checks.
        *   Vector operations: dot product, cross product, normalization.
** The Interactive & Visual Calculator**
*   Develop a user interface (UI) â€“ potentially a simple CLI first, then evolving to a GUI.
*   Allow users (myself, initially) to perform operations on the created objects.
*   Incorporate features to visualize concepts, such as:
    *   Plotting graphs of functions.
    *   Visualizing matrix transformations.
    *   Displaying geometric representations of vectors or complex numbers.

**Future Extensions:**
*   Incorporate concepts from Physics (e.g., kinematics, dynamics, fields).
*   Add modules for Astronomy (e.g., orbital mechanics, celestial coordinates).
*   Explore more advanced mathematical topics as I learn them.
