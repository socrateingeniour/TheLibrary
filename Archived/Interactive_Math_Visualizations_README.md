# Interactive Math Visualizations

## Project Description
This project focuses on creating interactive mathematical visualizations using Python and web technologies. The goal is to provide a platform where users can input mathematical parameters and visualize the results dynamically. This project integrates Python-based visualization tools with a responsive web interface, allowing users to explore mathematical concepts interactively.

## Roadmap

### Phase 1: Setup and Basics

1. **Learn the Basics**:
   - Study Python libraries for visualization, particularly `matplotlib` and `numpy`:
     - Learn to plot functions, generate fractals, and handle data arrays.
   - Learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript basics:
     - Focus on DOM manipulation, event handling, and responsive design.

2. **Setup Environment**:
   - Install Python, Flask, and required libraries.
   - Set up a project folder structure.

### Phase 2: Backend Visualization

1. **Create Python Visualizations**:
   - Implement scripts in `/scripts/visualizations.py` to generate math visualizations (e.g., function graphs, fractals).
   - Save generated visualizations as images.

2. **Set Up Flask Backend**:
   - Build Flask routes to serve static content (e.g., HTML, images).
   - Implement dynamic routes to generate visualizations based on user input.

3. **Test Backend**:
   - Use tools like Postman to test Flask endpoints.
   - Write unit tests and integration tests for the backend to ensure robustness.

### Phase 3: Frontend Interactivity

1. **Enhance Frontend**:
   - Create a basic HTML page with input fields for parameters (e.g., function coefficients).
   - Add styling using CSS for a clean UI.
   - Use responsive design techniques (e.g., media queries) for mobile compatibility.

2. **Integrate Frontend and Backend**:
   - Use JavaScript (Fetch API) to send user inputs to the backend and display results.
   - Implement dynamic updates without refreshing the page (AJAX requests).

3. **Validate User Input**:
   - Ensure proper validation of user inputs on both frontend and backend to prevent errors or malicious inputs.

### Phase 4: Integration and Deployment

1. **Advanced Interactivity**:
   - Use WebSockets for real-time updates (optional).
   - Add sliders or dropdowns for easier parameter adjustments.

2. **Deploy the Application**:
   - Use platforms like Heroku or AWS for deployment:
     - Create a `Procfile` for Heroku.
     - Set up environment variables for secure configuration.
   - Ensure the app is mobile-friendly and tested on various devices.

3. **Version Control**:
   - Use Git for version control:
     - Maintain a `.gitignore` file to exclude unnecessary files.
     - Use branches for feature development.

## Installation Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scriptsctivate
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the Flask application:
   ```bash
   flask run
   ```

## Contribution Guidelines

We welcome contributions from the community! To contribute:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature-name
   ```
3. Commit your changes and push the branch:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Description of changes"
   git push origin feature-name
   ```
4. Submit a pull request.

---

## Testing

### Backend Testing:

- Use `unittest` for Python:
  ```bash
  python -m unittest discover
  ```
- Test Flask endpoints with Postman or `curl`.

### Frontend Testing:

- Test the UI on various browsers and devices.
- Use browser developer tools to debug JavaScript and CSS.

---

## Troubleshooting

- **Issue**: Flask server not starting.
  - **Solution**: Ensure all dependencies are installed and the virtual environment is activated.
- **Issue**: Visualization not displaying.
  - **Solution**: Check the Python script for errors and ensure the output is saved in the correct directory.

### Project Structure

The project folder structure should be as follows:

```
/project-root
    |-- /static
    |   |-- styles.css
    |   |-- scripts.js
    |-- /templates
    |   |-- index.html
    |-- /scripts
    |   |-- visualizations.py
    |-- app.py
    |-- requirements.txt
```

This structure ensures that all the necessary files are in the correct places, keeping the project organized and maintainable.
